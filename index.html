        <p>Torque Titans Racing League (TTRL) Rulebook</p>

<p>1.             General Conduct</p>
<p>Always respect others in the server. Disrespectful behaviours include using offensive language, making personal attacks, posting inappropriate images or gifs, and any form of racism.</p>
<p>No inappropriate images or gifs.</p>
<p>No arguing over incidents in the chats. All incident discussions must be handled by the stewards through the proper channels.</p>
<p>1.3a.     Stewards handle all incident discussions.</p>
<p>No clips of incidents in the chat channels.</p>
<p>Nothing racist in the chats, ever!</p>
<p>1.6.        Remember, we are all here to have fun and enjoy the game, so let's leave any playground behaviour on the shelf.</p>
<p>2.             Race Night and Console Type</p>
<p>We will race crossplay.</p>
<p>2.1.        Special Rules for Crossplay Races: Crossplay races follow the same rules as regular races. However, drivers must ensure stable connectivity. If a driver is found to have poor connection repeatedly, they may be moved to the reserve list until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Sunday Nights
2 tiers, based on pace, 20:00 & 19:45 (UK time).
Full Qualifying (if more than 15 drivers) & 50% Race.</p>
<p>Wednesday Nights
20:00 (UK Time)
Short Qualifying + 35% & 25% races.
The 25% race grid will be the reverse of 35% finishing places.</p>
<p>3.             Attendance</p>
<p>3.1.        The cut-off for attendance is 1 hour before the race. The attendance app will not allow drivers to mark or change attendance after this time.</p>
<p>3.1a.     If reserves are waiting to race, your seat will be allocated to them.
3.1b.     If you want to race after the cut-off and the seat has already been taken, you will be allocated a</p>
<p>reserve seat if available.</p>
<p>3.2.        You will not score points in the driver or constructors championship as a reserve.</p>
<p>3.3          If a full-time driver misses a check-in for 2 consecutive weeks or marks attendance and doesn't show up to race, they will lose their seat for that race and be given a reserve role.</p>
<p>4.             Qualifying</p>
<p>4.1.        During qualifying, you must not use intermediate or wet tires unless in wet/damp conditions. Anyone seen doing so may be given a penalty by stewards.</p>
<p>4.2.        No blocking drivers on a flying lap. If someone behind you is faster, stay on your racing line if both drivers are on a flying lap. It is the duty of the driver behind to pass the slower car safely.</p>
<p>5.             Five-Minute Break</p>
<p>5.1.        After qualifying or the sprint concludes, we will wait on the starting grid for 5 minutes before readying up. This break allows drivers to submit urgent incident reports, take a toilet break, or grab a smoke before the race starts.</p>
<p>5.2.        Readying up early will result in a steward penalty.</p>
<p>6.             Racing</p>
<p>6.1.        Race starts are usually the most hectic in any form of racing. We ask that all drivers approach the first few corners with caution to avoid early incidents or damage.</p>
<p>6.2.        Always give space to each driver. Drivers are entitled to space if their front wheel is in line with your rear wheel.</p>
<p>6.3.        Under no circumstances is it acceptable to dive bomb a driver when overtaking. If you do this and cause damage to the defending driver, you will be punished if they report the clip to the stewards.</p>
<p>6.4.        No intentional crashing into another driver or attempting to DNF another driver. This could result in a full-season ban and possibly removal from the server.</p>
<p>6.5.        No continuous swerving on straights if a driver is trying to make a move.</p>
<p>6.6.        We want hard but clean racing at all times.</p>
<p>6.7.        Be mindful of other drivers when rejoining the track. Make sure you do so safely.</p>
<p>6.8.        Resetting to the track is highly prohibited and will result in steward penalties.</p>
<p>7.             Reserve Drivers</p>
<p>7.1.        Reserve drivers must have marked attendance using the reserve driver icon to be invited. Seats will be allocated by staff.</p>
<p>7.2.        Reserve drivers can qualify.</p>
<p>7.3.        Reserve drivers do not score points in drivers or constructors championships.</p>
<p>7.4.        Reserve drivers will be treated like a full-time driver regarding penalties issued by the Stewards.</p>
<p>8.             Safety Car</p>
<p>8.1.        Nobody likes to see a safety car unless you screwed up your first corners and took damage. Safety car restarts cause many problems as drivers are eager to get racing again. Every driver must keep their front tire behind the rear wheel of the driver in front upon race restart until the track goes green.</p>
<p>8.2.        Please maintain a 2-car gap to the car in front in case they have to slow down to reduce their deltas.</p>
<p>8.3.        Safety Car AI can be used to have/get a drink, quick toilet break, or add someone back into the game. However, if your AI unfairly gains a position, you should give it back, and if people are seen abusing this, they could receive penalty points (PP). We wouldn't expect anyone to be on AI for more than 1 lap under SC, and you are fully responsible for your AI (due to current issues with tyres warming up, use of AI under SC is strictly prohibited).</p>
<p> 8.4.      There is no overtaking during the safety car unless the car in front goes off track.</p>
<p>8.5.   	To bring the game into line with real F1 ‚ÄòAllowing lapped cars to pass Safety Car‚Äô all drivers are to pay attention and let lapped cars through 		under the safety car . </p>
<p>If the driver behind isn‚Äôt the driver in the standings in the top left corner , you are to pull the car completely off the track so they can pass .  If a 	driver pulls off the track only lapped cars are to pass and not that of any other car fighting for position . Failure to do so will result in a 10sec 	penalty and 3 pp .</p>
<p>*if you receive track warning while letting car pass , clip it and race director ‚Äòincident reports‚Äô and submit ticket</p>
<p>9.             Incident Reporting</p>
<p>9.1.        We understand people get annoyed if they DNF or take damage during a race; we all do. After qualifying/sprint concludes, we will wait on the starting grid for up to 5 minutes to allow drivers, if they wish, the opportunity to submit any incident reports that need to be urgently dealt with by stewards.</p>
<p>9.2.        Once the race has been completed, drivers have until 7 pm the following day to submit any reports to the stewards. 

It is the driver's responsibility to submit their POV footage when requested by the stewards in a ticket. Failure to provide the footage will result in the following penalties.
</p>
<p>First Time: Warning</p>
<p>Second Time: 1 penalty point</p>
<p>Third Time and Thereafter: Qualification ban</p>
<p>9.3.        All reports/appeals should be submitted to the ‚Å†üí•‚îÇincident-report or ‚Å†‚ùé‚îÇfia-appeals, where a ticket will be generated upon completion of the form.</p>
<p>9.4.        When submitting an incident report, you will need to provide specific details:</p>
<p>Who are you reporting? (e.g., No Fear)</p>
<p>Description of Incident (e.g., Blocking on my qualifying hot lap)</p>
<p>What session did this take place in? (e.g., Austria Sprint qualifying)</p>
<p>What lap & turn? (e.g., Lap 1 / Turn 5)</p>
<p>Clip of incident: Add this in the opened ticket (visual evidence is crucial for the stewards' assessment)</p>
<p>9.5.        You will see a ticket at the bottom of the Ticket Section category. Stewards will remove it from viewing to allow stewards/FIA to discuss.</p>
<p>9.6.        The driver being reported will be invited for their input, and once they give their POV, they will be removed from ticket view.</p>
<p>9.7.        When submitting an 'Incident Report,' the Stewards/FIA reserve the right to issue a penalty against the submitter if deemed so. Once a ticket is raised, it is for the Stewards to decide if it can be withdrawn.</p>
<p>9.8.        Once a decision has been reached, the ticket will be closed, and the decision will be published in the ‚Å†'stewards-fia-outcomes' channel in each tier.</p>
<p>10.          FIA Appeals</p>
<p>10.1.     An incident can be appealed to the FIA if you feel the stewards have made the wrong decision.</p>
<p>10.2.     If you disagree with the steward's decision, DO NOT confront them; appeal using the ‚Å†‚ùé‚îÇfia-appeals channel.</p>
<p>10.3.     Give the reason for your appeal and re-submit your original POV clip and any new evidence (if you have any).</p>
<p>10.4.     FIA decisions are final.</p>
<p>10.5.     Under no circumstances can an incident be discussed in the main chats, as this causes arguments, and nobody wants a warning from the owners!</p>
<p>10.6. Under no circumstances should a steward be contacted by DM to complain about the outcome of a ticket. These decisions are made by a group, not an individual.</p>
<p>11.          Stewards Penalties</p>
<p>11.1.     Penalty System Overview: The time penalties and actions listed are guidelines for the stewards. Stewards have the discretion to increase or decrease penalties if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>11.2.     Penalty System:</p>
<p>11.3. Notes on Penalties:</p>
<p>The penalties and actions listed above serve as a guide to the stewards. Stewards have the discretion to increase or decrease penalties if deemed appropriate based on the circumstances of each incident.</p>
<p>12. License Point System</p>
<p>12.1. Stewards will follow a penalty point system for each reported incident.
12.1a. If a driver is at fault, they will receive penalty points.</p>
<p>12.2. Penalty Points Thresholds:</p>
<p>3 Points: Time penalty for the next driver's race (5 seconds).</p>
<p>5 Points: Position drop for the next driver's race (3 positions).</p>
<p>8 Points: Qualification ban.</p>
<p>15 Points: Race ban.</p>
<p>20 Points: Driver championship points drop (5 points).</p>
<p>25 Points: Driver championship points drop (10 points).</p>
<p>30 Points: Season ban.</p>
<p>35 Points: League ban.</p>
<p>12.3. Penalty Points Drop Policy:</p>
<p>A driver may drop 1 penalty point after 3 consecutive clean races.</p>
<p>A "clean race" is defined as one where no steward penalties are issued.</p>
<p>12.4. Warnings Policy:</p>
<p>Drivers will receive a penalty point after accumulating 3 warnings.</p>
<p>One penalty point is applied for each set of 3 warnings.</p>
<p>Warnings are cleared when all penalty points have been dropped.</p>
<p>12.5. Accumulation of points will result in a qualifying ban, race ban, season ban, or removal from the league based on the thresholds outlined above.</p>
<p>12.6. This information can also be found on the üî•‚îÇrace-license channel in the server.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
