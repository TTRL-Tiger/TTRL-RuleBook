        <section id="general-conduct">
            <h2>General Conduct</h2>
            <p>Always respect others in the server. Disrespectful behaviours include offensive language, personal attacks, posting inappropriate images or gifs, and any form of racism.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="race-night-and-console-type">
            <h2>Race Night and Console Type</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sunday Nights:</strong> Full qualifying and 50% races.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday Nights:</strong> Short qualifying + 35% and 25% races. The 25% race grid is the reverse of the 35% race results.</li>

        <section id="attendance">
            <h2>Attendance</h2>

        <section id="five-minute-break">
            <h2>Five-Minute Break</h2>
            <p>A 5-minute break follows qualifying or the sprint session. Drivers may use this time to report incidents, take a quick break, or prepare for the race.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="racing">
            <h2>Racing</h2>
            <p>Race starts are hectic; approach with caution to avoid early incidents. Always give space to other drivers, and avoid dive-bombing or intentional crashing.</p>
            <p>Drivers rejoining the track must do so safely. Resetting to track is prohibited and will result in penalties.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="reserve-drivers">
            <h2>Reserve Drivers</h2>
            <p>Reserve drivers must mark attendance using the reserve icon. They can qualify but do not score points in the championship.</p>

        <section id="fia-appeals">
            <h2>FIA Appeals</h2>
            <p>An incident can be appealed to the FIA if you feel the stewards have made the wrong decision. Provide your original POV and any new evidence with your appeal.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="stewards-penalties">
            <h2>Stewards Penalties</h2>
            <p>The penalties listed serve as a guide for stewards. Penalty points are applied based on infractions, and repeated offenses can lead to severe consequences.</p>

        <section id="license-point-system">
            <h2>License Point System</h2>
